[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/martinlindhe/dustbox-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/martinlindhe/dustbox-rs)

PC x86 emulator with the goal of easily running MS-DOS games on Windows, macOS and Linux.

In the current state, dustbox runs a some demos and is still in it's early stages.
If you are looking for a more complete dos emulator, I suggest you check out [dosbox-x](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x).

## Contributing

Any help and contributions are much welcome!

## Running

To launch the debugger:

```sh
cargo run --package dustbox_debugger
```

then interact with the debugger using the input box ('help' to get started).

To launch the front-end:

```sh
cargo run --package dustbox_frontend path-to-dos-executable
```

## Tests

Run the basic tests with

```sh
cargo test --all
```

There is additional tests that are expensive, they also generate the tests/render/demo images.

In order to run the expensive tests you need to check out the dos-software-decoding repo in the parent directory and pass the `--ignored` flag to cargo:

```sh
cd .. && git clone https://github.com/martinlindhe/dos-software-decoding && cd -
cargo test --release -- --ignored
```
